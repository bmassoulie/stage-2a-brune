You have produced some very good work demonstrating a good understanding and knowledge of the unit. I liked that you applied a theoretical underpinning and you may want to consider including visuals in future assignments as these can support the narrative content, providing additional evidence. 
You will notice your URKUND score was highlighted 24%, this was mainly contributed to by the AC numbering/headings and templates, however there were some similarities of text. I do not believe this to be plagiarism but please ensure all work submitted is in your own words. 
You have taken the time to reflect against your performance, identifying key development areas for your PDP, this will no doubt increase your professional competence and help you develop through the core professional areas.  
Again, well done and good luck with future submissions. 
Regards
Vanessa

When the input is connected to low level signal 0 V, then the transistor will be reverse biased. So no current will flow through it, thus it remains in OFF. As there is no current flow through transistor, there will be no voltage drop across the resistor. So the output will correspond to +5 Volts making the output logic HIGH.
But if +5 V connected to the input, the output voltage will become 0. The transistor designed NOT gate is shown below.

After more than two years of learning, working, and creating memories here in DXC Technology, I am bidding adieu today!
It’s been great interacting and knowing each one of you. With many of you, I have shared a unique camaraderie which I hope will continue in the years to come.
I loved working on our group projects, the meals & walks that we shared while brainstorming for new ideas. But the real struggle was always to decide a place to order our evening snacks or coming up with Friday party plans!!
I will truly cherish all these memories.
As I move on to pursue other career opportunities I will always be available at my email address vishalggrwl@hotmail.com and on my cell phone +91-9899279390.
We can also stay connected on LinkedIn - @Iamvishalggrwl.
I wish you All the Best.
Thank you again for these fantastic 2 years and I hope that our paths will cross again in the future.

Integrals and RMS Signals
Background
The average or mean of a set of numbers is found by adding up the numbers and dividing by the number of numbers. The mean value of a function is the generalization of this idea. The mean value of any function f(x) is defined as the mean height of the function. It can be found by calculating the area under the function and dividing by the width of the function. We will denote the mean value of a function f using angle brackets like this:
Then using calculus notation the above statement can be written as:
 
(We are assuming that the function runs from a to b, so integrating from a to b gives the area under the function and dividing by b - a divides by the width of the function.)
If the function is periodic (i.e. if the function repeats itself exactly after a certain amount of time, called the period, T) then we can replace the above formula by this formula:
 
In other words we only have to find the area for one cycle and divide by the width of one cycle.
The RMS value of a function is related to the idea of the standard deviation of a set of numbers.

I maintained a constant pace, as I was swimming at 60%. Afterwards, we had the opportunity to practice our dives. I decided to do two breaststroke breakouts, and two butterfly breakouts. After this, I switched into my racing bathing suit, put on two swim caps and reviewed my events. As the 200m backstroke finished, I walked to my block and tightened my goggles. I listened for the whistle, I got on the block and took a deep breath. When I heard the referee say “take your marks,” I tightened my grip on the block and when I heard the beep, I immediately dove off the block into a streamline position. I did a long dolphin kick, then finished my breakout at around eight meters. It took me seven strokes to get me to the 25m point. My first 50m has been just under 41 seconds. My second fifty were around 45 seconds and as I became more exhausted, my third fifty took me 46 seconds. My final 50 took 44 seconds. My final time was 2:59.34 seconds. I came out of the water breathing heavily.

On the other hand, other sites, sharing the proximity of lakes, occupying large tracts of land and also presenting a consistent architectural distinction within the inhabited area, have been considered to be chronologically associated with the Bronze Age. 
This decision is based on the paleo-environmental understanding of the phases between the 6th and 5th-4th millennia BC, when the Holocene rainfall optimum had passed and the Indian monsoon, which had favoured its copious rainfall, regressed towards the south-east, settling on its present-day trajectories. In a landscape that was drying out due to the gradual increase in temperatures, human communities, mainly characterised by nomadic groups devoted to pastoralism, were joined together in ecological niches, such as lake basins.
These fatal climatic changes not only affected the human communities but also and above all the wild herds that migrated through the Harrat. That forced them to seek new migratory trajectories and the human groups, no longer able to base their livelihood on previous strategies, found themselves concentrating in sites where the mild climatic conditions allowed the presence of a sustainable lake ecosystem. 
It is interesting to note how the largest sites associated with the Harrat Bronze Age (S2 with more than 80 covered hectares and S3 with more than 30 hectares) are located in the eastern half of the great basaltic platform, respectively east of the course of the Wadi Al U'ayli - constituting a real geographical watershed between the two parts of the sector analysed -

Dear diary,
I really feel great. When I go out of the stupid setting were I’ve been trapped for over 25 years, I went to court to claim justice. The Truman show won a lot of money on my behalf so when I won the trial, I received 10 million dollars and 1000$ per weeks for the rest of my life. All the actors were arrested and they deserve it for what they did to me. The first thing that I did when I walked out of seaheaven (even before the trial) was finding Sylvia. She stayed with me during all the trial and when I won, I asked her to come to the Fijis with me. I proposed to her there whit the most beautiful ring I could found and we were married the week after. yes, it was a little fast but we loved each other and life was too short to waste it on details. We bought a villa in the middle of laucala in the Fijis and we lived there 20 years until Sylvia died of breast cancer. We’ve had 3 beautiful kids; Mary who’s now 30 years, Francis who’s 25 years and Theresa who’s now 33 years. I’m not a grandfather yet but I hope to live long enough to see them one day. A thing that I admire is electronics devices. There was a television and a google home in each room, even the bathroom. Now I","Dear diary,I really feel great.

39930455,"A portion of the municipality of Arborea (OR) in Sardinia, covering an area of approximately 62 km2, was designated a nitrate vulnerable zone in 2005 in application of Directive 91/676/EEC. 
This is an area of high livestock intensity with approximately 150 dairy cattle farms and a livestock load per hectare that is much higher than the regional average. 
The designation was followed by the Action Programme, which laid down a whole series of obligations for structural and managerial adjustments in the agronomic use of effluents. The main problem, which emerged as a result of this regulatory evolution, is the management of the zootechnical nitrogen surplus, which largely exceeds the limit of 170 kg/ha/year set by the Directive, entailing heavy burdens in the movement to third parties located outside the NVZ. 
It is precisely in this respect that the relive-waste project can represent an important element in the range of possible interventions for a sustainable management, both from an environmental and economic point of view, of surplus zootechnical liquid manure.

39686091,"To illustrate my application with a pricing case, I wanted to discuss Apple's pricing strategy regarding their smartphone. At launch, Apple charged a high price for their product to benefit from their monopolistic position in the market. The promise was simple: one premium product and one premium price (with variations depending on storage capacities). Over the time, Apple adapted its pricing strategy to prevent from the competition but also to capture different willingness to pay by proposing a large price range for their new products. Even thought, they still respect their initial promise and maintain a premium product with a premium price for their clients who value their products since the beginning which is probably the most valuable aspect of their pricing strategy. This pricing case isn't particularly relevant in the context of health care, but still I'm convinced that analogies with other economic sectors should be encouraged regarding pricing strategies. Recently applied to pharmaceuticals, analogies led to innovative pricing strategies (e.g., the Netflix subscription-based model for anti-HCV in Australia and for antibiotics in UK) that provide better access for patients.","To illustrate my application with a pricing case, I wanted to discuss Apple's pricing strategy regarding their smartphone.

39666822,"Thanks Gary for your response. As Gary rightly said, reduce the Soft Bit word length and traceback lengths are the best options to reduce resource usage. 
Coming to WHDL version, the main reasons to limit the trace back depth as follows
• I didn’t observe much performance difference after increases the traceback length at that point. 
• The recommended depths are 5 times or 10 times the constraint lengths (max value is 9 for most of the polynomials)
• Its directly proposition to HW resources.
• WHDL Viterbi used K-pointer algorithm for HW implementation. The K-pointer, gives you nearly two times, track back depth (TBD) compared to register based Viterbi decoder implementation. We ran the simulations and observed that 1.5 Tbd performances. Suppose, Tbd = 128 chosen on the block, it gives 192 Tbd performance compared to register based Viterbi.
Trace back depth limitation can be changed by simply remove that error, Block can handle any Tbd with the cost of resources. 
I think it helps, let me know if any further inputs required.

Thus, a property owner who has not secured or whose entitlement is invalid would be unable to occupy finished properties. This is because the building authority requires such certifications and documentation from eligible individuals such as an architect, professional engineer, or developer. Thus, if the term of the occupancy permit requires longer to allow or is denied, the buildings can be vacant.","Principally, Brunei Darussalam does not have clear laws governing abandoned buildings; however, the problems surrounding building abandonment can be seen in a portion of the Building Control Order, 2014 on section 16 and the Building Control Regulations, 2014 on part 6 section 55, which apply to building occupant permits, which enable buildings to be inhabited permanently or temporarily.

Firstly, this diagram indicates that by placing indirect taxes on products, it would increase the price from P1,Q1 to P2,Q2 because there are no incentives for consumers, leading to decreased demand whilst at a high price. The tax benefit in this case would increase the EV’s demanded in society as the price of electric vehicles would decrease, hence the supply+Tax(P2,Q2) would shift rightward to Supply+Tax Benefit(P3,Q3), the quantity of EV’s demanded increases from Q1 to Q3, moving the price and production closer to the optimum level of output. The tax incidence is paid at similar prices between consumers and producers, it can be indicated comparing the red region to the green.

From the third century BC, scholars prepared glosses into distinct glossaries at the library in Alexandria. unfortunately, almost all of them have been mislaid. 
 In the second century AD, a different kind of Greek lexicography developed, because of the puristic linguistic movement known as Atticism.  During the Roman Empire, the form of Greek was regarded by the literati as ‘incorrect’ or ‘impure’.
